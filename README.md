# Food Searcher (Neighborhood Map Project)

This app allows the user to search for tasty food in the neighborhood based on
Yelp API data. Enter a dish or cuisine you are looking for in the search bar
and you will see a list of restaurants that match the query with corresponding
points on the map.

## Usage

App is live on rsasson.github.io until repo is moved after grading,
alternatively you can run the app locally by accessing opening index.html
in your browser.
